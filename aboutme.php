      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi my name is Chris Hamilton and I'm an aspiring front-end developer.
        I graduated from Phillip O. Berry Academy of Technology 2014.
        Also briefly attended University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
        The day to day for me is basically designing/building websites and when I'm not working you can
        find me socializing with my friends and watching movies.
        Some life goals I would like to complete would be traveling outside the country,
        starting a movie podcast, and being financially stable enough to pursue
        anything that will bring me happiness. Let's work together!
      </p>
